        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>On a big bowl, mix the wheat flour with salt and yeast. Add water little by little, mixing with a spatula to incorporate.
                Let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. So the flour absorbs water better;</li>
            <li>After the 10 minutes of rest, with the spatula, turn and fold the dough over itself, until it is in an easier consistency to handle.
                Transfer the dough to the countertop and knead for about 15 minutes - fold, knead, stretch and knead again until very smooth, soft and moist.
                If you prefer, you can knead the dough in the mixer with the hook on low speed;</li>
            <li>Coat a large bowl with olive oil. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to the greased bowl.
                Cover with a dish towel (or film) and leave at room temperature to rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in volume.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, sprinkle some flour on the countertop and knead the dough again for another 5 minutes.
                Model a ball again, cover with the dish cloth and let the dough rest for another 10 minutes.
                Meanwhile, separate a large roast and sprinkle with wheat flour.</li>
            <li>On the countertop, cut the dough in half with a spatula (or knife) and shape two round loaves.
                Transfer the buns to the baking sheet with the dough seam facing down,
                cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220Â°C (high temperature) - this way the oven will reach the right temperature by the time the bread is risen.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, with the tip of a sharp knife (or stiletto), make 3 parallel cuts on the surface of each bread.
                Sprinkle with water and place in the oven. Bake for about 30 minutes until the skin is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once baked, remove the pan from the oven and carefully transfer the buns to a wire rack. Let cool before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
